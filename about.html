      I was raised in Chicago and lived in Haiti for 3 years.
      I'm currently pursuing a major in Information Science with a focus on UX Desing at the University of Michigan. I've always been interested in technology,
      however, I've also been interested in the intersection of business and tech and found that the University of Michigan's School of Information would provide me with both of those areas of study. When I'm not working on design or programming project,
      you can usually find me making music, either on my laptop and keyboard or on a more traditional classical piano. Since I was a kid, I've always loved playing music and have been surrounded by
      musicians. Both of my parents are musicians withmy dad having toured in a famous Haitian band called Boukman Eksperyans and was even nominated for a Grammy.
   </p>
   <p> In the future, I hope to one day use the skills I have acquired through my years in education and start my own company in tech.
     I've always dreamed of being a successful entrepreneur as I've always believed that the years of hard work to get there is worth the freedom in the end.
     Being self-employed is something I constantly think about strive towards and believe that the skills I learn in the BSI program are instrumental in helping me get there.
